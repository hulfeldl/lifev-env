# LifeV environment

Aim of this repository is to create a development environment in order to simplify the configuration of LifeV and the installation of the necessary third-part libraries.

For further details, see [this page](https://bitbucket.org/lifev-dev/lifev-release/wiki/lifev-env) on the official LifeV wiki.

Her you find many `clone_*.sh` files. If you are not a developer, you only need
  
  `clone_lifev_release.sh`
  
All the other files are for the developers.
