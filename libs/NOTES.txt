Troubleshooting:

 - If wget gives the error "ERROR 404: Not Found" the link to download the
   package could be outdated, or the version requested could be too old. Go to
   the website of the package and check the latest version and the link to
   download the source package, then change the build script accordingly.

 - Sometimes, if CMake gives you "strange" errors, try to manually delete the
   configured directory and re-run cmake.
